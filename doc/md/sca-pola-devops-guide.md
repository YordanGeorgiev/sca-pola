    bash src/bash/sca-pola/sca-pola.sh -a mojo-morbo-stop

## 3. USAGE SCENARIOS


    

### 3.1. Shell based actions usage


    

#### 3.1.1. Run increase-date action
You track the issues of your projects by storing them into xls files in "daily" proj_txt dirs. 
Each time the day changes by running the increase-date action you will be able to clone the data of the previous date and start working on the currnent date. 

    bash src/bash/sca-pola/sca-pola.sh -a increase-date

#### 3.1.2. Run xls-to-db action
You insert the date of the daily , weekly , monthly or yearly issues from the daily input excel file(s) by running the xls-to-db action. 
If you have the guid column with uuid's than this will be upsert and not bare insert.
You should be able to update only non-nullable column by reducing the number of columns in your xls sheet.

    
    export do_truncate_tables=1 ;
    bash src/bash/sca-pola/sca-pola.sh -a xls-to-db

#### 3.1.3. Run db-to-txt action
 

     

#### 3.1.4. Load xls issues to db and from db to txt files
to load xls issues to db and from db to txt files

    bash src/bash/sca-pola/sca-pola.sh -a xls-to-db -a db-to-txt 
    
    # or run for all the periods
    for period in `echo daily weekly monthly yearly`; do export period=$period ; 
    bash src/bash/sca-pola/sca-pola.sh -a xls-to-db -a db-to-txt ; done ;

#### 3.1.5. Run the sca-pola file to db load
Run the sca-pola file to db load 

    # ensure the following actions will be tested
    cat src/bash/sca-pola/tests/run-sca-pola-tests.lst | grep -v '#'
    # output should be if not correct
    check-perl-syntax
    run-sca-pola
    
    # test those uncommented actions
    bash src/bash/sca-pola/test-sca-pola.sh

#### 3.1.6. Verify the inserted data from the db
Verify the inserted data from the db as follows:

    # check that the rows where inserted
    echo 'SELECT * FROM issue ; ' | psql -d dev_sca_pola

### 3.2. web based routes usage


    

#### 3.2.1. Run the http://&lt;&lt;web-host&gt;&gt;:&lt;&lt;web-port&gt;&gt;/&lt;&lt;proj-db&gt;&gt;/get/&lt;&lt;table&gt;&gt;/&lt;&lt;guid&gt;&gt; route
Load a table with guid's.
Check a single item with your browser, for example:
http://host-name:3000/dev_stockit_issues/get/company_eps/727cf807-c9f1-446b-a7fc-65f9dc53ed2d

    # load the items
    while read -r f; do 
    export xls_file=$f; 
    bash src/bash/sca-pola/sca-pola.sh -a xls-to-db  ; 
    done < <(find $proj_txt_dir -type f)
    
    # verify the data
    psql -d $postgres_db_name -c "SELECT * FROM company_eps "

## 4. BUSINESS LOGIC


    

### 4.1. Projects management
You can manage multiple projects with the sca-pola tool. Each project has its own data directories, database storage and configurations. You could also have different envornments named dev,tst,prd for each project separately. 
As the tool is backwards compatible you could have differrrent instances of the sca-pola projects with different versions ( and set of features ) operatiing against differrent project ( each one in its own version).
You must pre-set the configuration variables of an sca-pola project each time you start working on a project from the shell

    doParseIniEnvVars /vagrant/csitea/cnf/projects/isg-pub/isg-pub.sca-pola.host-name.conf

### 4.2. Increase the date for all projects
to increase the date for all the projects at once use the following oneliner.

    while read -r f ; do doParseIniEnvVars $f ; bash src/bash/sca-pola/sca-pola.sh -a increase-date ; done < <(find doParseIniEnvVars /vagrant/csitea/cnf/projects/sca-pola/ -type f)

### 4.3. Categories
Each issue item could be categorized under one and only one category. One category might have 1 or more issues. 
The categories could contain letters ,numbers, dashes

    Examples:
    organisation-it
    organisation-it-operations

#### 4.3.1. Issues / Issue items / items
Issue item is the shortest possible description of task , activity , note or anything requiring distinguishable and prerferable measurable action or producing verfifiable outcome.
Issues could be of different types - tasks, activities, notes etc. 

    Examples:
    go get the milk
    do the homework
    procurement e-mail discussion follow-up

#### 4.3.2. to search for the project daily file
to search for the project daily file run the following liner first to start the dev server of the react mini-app.
Than point your broser at the following url:
http://host-name:3307/
( Hardcoded for now … ) 

    bash src/bash/sca-pola/sca-pola.sh -a mojo-morbo-start

## 5. NAMING CONVENTIONS


     

### 5.1. Dirs naming conventions
The dir structure should be logical and a person navigating to a dir should almost understand what is to be find in thre by its name .. 

    

### 5.2. Root Dirs naming conventions
The root dirs and named as follows:
bin - contains the produced binaries for th project
cnf - for the configuration
dat - for the data of the app
lib - for any external libraries used
src - for the source code of the actual projects and subprojects

    

## 6. SOURCE CODE MANAGEMENT
The sca-pola is a derivative of the wrapp tool - this means that development and deployment process must be integrated into a single pipeline. 

    

### 6.1. The meaning of the used brances
In almost all development projects there are slightly or even quite big differences between what type of code in which branch is situated. 
The ideology of issue tracker is that the code which is under active development is in the dev branch , the code which is under testing in the tst branch , the code which is in production in the prd branch. 
Only after the code in production has been successfully operated and prooved working it could be moved to the master branch and the version increased. 
Once you wanto to start adding new feature branch from the master branch.
